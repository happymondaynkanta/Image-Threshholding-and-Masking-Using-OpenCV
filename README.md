# Thresholding and Masking Using OpenCV
This repository contains simple codes to perform image thresholding and masking. 
Image thresholding is used for image segmentation. Thresholding is the simplest method of image segmentation. From a grayscale image, thresholding can be used to create binary images.
In Thresholding we Pick a threshold T.
1.Pixels above threshold get new intensity A.
2.Pixels above threshold get new intensity B.  
In Thresholding, pixels that are alike in gray scale(or in some other feature) are grouped together.
